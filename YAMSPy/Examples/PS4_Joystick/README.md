This directory has more than only an example of how to use a PS4 joystick to control a drone with YAMSPy. Actually, it's a whole interface that I was using to [control a drone automatically](control_node.py) by using a [Time-of-Flight distance sensor (altitude)](tof_node.py) and an [Optical Flow sensor (XY)](optflow_node.py).
Moreover, the script [`ps4_joystick_async.py`](ps4_joystick_async.py) keeps track of battery voltage, launches extra processes, etc. If you just want to control a drone using a PS4 joystick you can use [that script](ps4_joystick_async.py) as a base and trim out all the extra stuff.
